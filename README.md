# burpsuite-updater
An automatic updater for the burpsuite-pro jar

To start Burp Suite run the start.sh, it will run the updater automatically so every time you start burp you can be sure it is the latest version.
You can create a symlink to the start.sh script so you could run burp from any location by writing
sudo ln -s [Path to Burp]/start.sh /opt/burp

Enjoy!
